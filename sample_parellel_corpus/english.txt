No.38 01 1971 and Section 12(4) 01 the National Dangerous Drugs Control Board Act, No. 11
01 1984. My comments and observations Which I consider should be published With the
Annual Report 01 the Board in terms 01 50011011 14(2) (c) 01 1110 Finance Act appear in this
report.
1.2 Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation 01 these ﬁnancial
statements in accordance With 511 Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards and for
such internal control as the management determines is necessary 10 enable the
preparation 01 ﬁnancial statements that are 1100 110111 material misstatements, Whether
due 10 fraud 01 01101.
1.3 Auditor’s Responsibility
My responsibility is 10 express an opinion 011 these ﬁnancial statements based on my
audit. I conducted my audit in accordance With Sri Lanka Auditing Standards
consistent With International Standards 01 Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAI 1000 —
1810). Those Standards require that I comply With ethical requirements and plan and
perform the audit 10 obtain reasonable assurance about Whether the ﬁnancial
statements are free from material misstatements.
An audit involves performing procedures 10 obtain audit evidence about the amounts
and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements. The procedures selected depend on the
auditor’s judgment, including the assessment 01 1110 risks of material misstatement 01
1110 ﬁnancial statements, Whether due to fraud 01 01101. 111 making those risk
assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Board’s preparation
and fair presentation 01 1110 ﬁnancial statements in order to design audit procedures

that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
Opinion on the effectiveness of the Board’s internal control. An audit also includes
evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. Sub - sections (3) and (4) 0f the Section 13 cf
